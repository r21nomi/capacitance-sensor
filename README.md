## Setup
### Arduino
<img src="assets/schematic.jpg" width="250"/>  

1. Write [Arduino_sensing.ino](https://github.com/r21nomi/capacitance-sensor/blob/master/Arduino_sensing/Arduino_sensing.ino) to your board

### SuperCollider
1. Open [sound.scd](https://github.com/r21nomi/capacitance-sensor/blob/master/audio/sound.scd)
2. `Language > Boot Server`
3. Select whole program
4. `Language > Evaluate Selection, Line or Region`

### Processing
1. Connect your PC to power source
2. Connect Arduino
3. Run [Visualizer.pde](https://github.com/r21nomi/capacitance-sensor/blob/master/Visualizer/Visualizer.pde)
4. Change the number of serial port with the value on console
5. Run again
6. Change the values `VOL_MIN`, `VOL_MAX` and `BOUNDARY` with the values on console  

â€»To run the program again, once you need to unplug the USB, and connect it to PC again
```shell
Error, disabling serialEvent() for /dev/cu.usbmodem1411
null
```
